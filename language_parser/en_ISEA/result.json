From this visualization, it is possible to see how many audio events happened in one audio file. In addition, the chunks are heard as time series. Every audio file has different sonic events and feature distinctions. Each music file can have its own form and figure in this visualization.

It is through the intensive communication with computers and social networks that one currently delineates life, work and leisure time, representing our self to others in a permanent and often curated way within a narrative.

One ominous future view on this, points to the standardization, normalization and complete control of our behaviour through newer/stronger affective technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, 3D virtual interaction, ubiquitous and wearable computing, etc. Emerging from the analysis of virtual aesthetics, dual subjectivity and myth-making\u2014all at the centre of my doctoral research\u2014I present an alternate view that stems from SL-Based Art and the examination of the topics above mentioned.

Reversing our expectation of games as playful and political action as non-playful, Yellow Umbrella posits protests as sites of play and videogames as political. The game ultimately instructs the player how the actual demonstrations would eventually conclude: in a peaceful manner without concessions by the central government.
